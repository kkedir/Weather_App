# Weather App
This is a simple web application built with Flask that provides current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for any city. The app retrieves weather data using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and converts the temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit for display.

## Features
- **City Search**: Enter the name of any city to view current weather and a 5-day forecast.
- **Current Weather**: Displays the current temperature, weather condition, wind speed, and high and low temperatures.
- **5-Day Forecast**: Shows the predicted weather and temperatures for the next five days at noon.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error page for invalid city names or when there are issues fetching data.
